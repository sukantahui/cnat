আমরা আলোচনা করবো ডেটা স্ট্রাকচার ও তার বিভিন্ন প্রকারভেদ সম্পর্কে। এই বিষয়ে আলোচনা করার পূর্বে আমরা আমাদের প্রতিদিনের ব্যবহারিক জীবনে এমন কিছু পরিচিত উদাহরণ নিয়ে আলোচনা করবো যাতে ডেটা স্ট্রাকচার সম্পর্কে আমাদের ধারণা আরও সুস্পষ্ট হবে। আমরা প্রায়ই আমাদের স্কুল, কলেজ কিংবা পাড়ার লাইব্রেরী দেখে থাকি, সেখানে একটি নির্দিষ্ট পরিব্যাপ্ত বইগুলির সাজানো থাকে, যাতে আমাদের যে কোনো একটি নির্দিষ্ট বই খুঁজে পেতে সুবিধা হয়। ধরা যাক, কোনো একটি লাইব্রেরিতে সায়েন্স বিভাগের বইগুলি একদিকে সাজানো থাকে এবং আরেকদিকে কমার্স বিভাগের বইগুলি সাজানো থাকে। অথবা কোনো বড় লাইব্রেরিতে বইগুলি নির্দিষ্ট নিয়মে বিবিধ ভাগে ভাগ থাকে — যাতে প্রয়োজন অনুযায়ী সেই বিভাগের সেই সাবজেক্ট-এর বই সহজেই আমরা খুঁজে পেতে পারি। আবার, তোমরা তোমাদের প্রত্যেকের বাড়িতেই ফ্রিজ দেখেছো, ফ্রিজ কি থাকে? ফ্রিজের ভেতর বিভিন্ন ধরনের খাদ্য উপাদান নির্দিষ্ট সাজে আমরা রাখতে পারি। ফলের জন্য থাকে একরকম, সবজির জন্য আলাদা অংশ এবং মাছ মাংসের জন্যও আলাদা অংশ। সাধারণত ফ্রিজের ওপরের অংশে (ডিপ ফ্রিজ) থাকে আইসক্রিম ও বরফ তৈরি করতে বা রাখতে পারি। নিচের দিকে তিনটি বা পরপর বক্সের মতো অংশে খাবার রাখা যায় যেমন সবজি (vegetables), ফল (fruits) ইত্যাদি। যারা বাড়িতে ফ্রিজার যুক্ত ফ্রিজ আছে তাদের ফ্রিজের নিচে আরও দুটি পরপর ড্রয়ার থাকে যেখানে সবজি ও ফ্রীজিং-এ রাখার উপকরণ রাখা যায়। একইভাবে লাইব্রেরি যেমন একটি বস্তুকে কোথায় রাখা হচ্ছে সেটা সঠিক, একইভাবে ফ্রিজও তাই। ফ্রিজের দরাজগুলো তিন দিকে সাজানো থাকে, একদিকে মাংস রাখার বেল্ট, একটি অংশে ফলমূল, সবজী, ভোজ্য সামগ্রী, আবার আরও ওপরের দিকে বোতলের পরপর সাজানো থাকে, এছাড়াও নিচের অংশে মেডিসিন সেটের জায়গা থাকে। ঠিক এরকমই আমাদের প্রতিদিনের জীবনে প্রাচীন কালের সাজানো উপাদানসমূহ ব্যবস্থার কারণে আমরা বস্তুগুলিকে নির্দিষ্টভাবে রাখতে পারি। একইভাবে ডেটা স্ট্রাকচারও কম্পিউটারের ভেতরে বিভিন্ন ধরনের তথ্যকে সাজিয়ে রাখার নির্দিষ্ট নিয়ম, যাতে তথ্যকে সহজে অ্যাক্সেস করা যায়। মডার্ন কম্পিউটারের অ্যাপ্লিকেশন যেমন লাইব্রেরি, আমাদের দৈনন্দিন জীবনের ব্যবহার লাইব্রেরি বা ফ্রিজের সকল কিছু কাজ আমরা ডেটা স্ট্রাকচারের মাধ্যমে করতে পারি, মানে, লাইব্রেরী মতো ডেটাগুলিকে একটা নির্দিষ্টভাবে সাজিয়ে রাখতে পারি। ডেটা স্ট্রাকচার এমন একগুচ্ছ ডেটা আইটেমসকে একটি নির্দিষ্টভাবে সাজিয়ে রাখার রীতি বলা হয় যাতে ডেটাগুলির ব্যবহার সহজ হয়। ডেটা স্ট্রাকচারকে সাজানোর বিভিন্ন পদ্ধতিকে অলগরিদম বলা হয় যাতে অলগরিদমের মাধ্যমে
